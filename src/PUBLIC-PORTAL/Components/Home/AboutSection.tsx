                The Scheme was launched at Thiruvananthapuram on December 18, 1962 by the then 
                General Secretary of Canara Bank Employees' Union Com A N Balasubramaniam, as per 
                the decision taken at the 21st Conference held at Chennai from 5th to 8th January 1962.
              </p>

              <p>
                The Rules and Regulations for the Scheme were formulated by the Central Committee 
                held at Goa on 29th and 30th June 2012. The seeds for such a glorious Scheme were 
                sown in the soil of Kerala very much earlier and crystallised with comrades from Galls 
                providing actuarial inputs.
              </p>

              <p>
                The Scheme was launched with a humble refundable contribution of Rs. 50/- per month 
                per member and was initially providing a lumpsum relief of Rs. 30,000/- to the nominee 
                of a deceased member. Over the years, the lumpsum relief has been enhanced to the 
                present level of Rs. 1,00,000/-.
              </p>

              <p>
                The Scheme also gives monthly pension of upto Rs. 1,250/- to such eligible nominees. 
                The present monthly contribution is Rs. 200/- per member per month and is fully 
                refundable at the time of retirement of the member.
